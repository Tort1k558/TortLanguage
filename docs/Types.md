# Types

There are currently 4 data types available in the language:

- string
- int
- double
- bool

This list will be expanded

**String** - This data type is a sequence of characters and is limited to quotation marks. At the moment, the compiler does not have the ability to change them. For example: "Hello, world!". Strings can contain any characters, including letters, numbers, special characters, and spaces.

**Int** - This data type is an integer value without a decimal part. For example: 42 or -10.

**Double** - This data type is a floating-point numeric value. It can have a decimal part and an exponent. For example: 10.9 , 5.333

**Bool** - This data type can have only two values: true  or false.
