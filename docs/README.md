# Tort

**Tort** - is a custom programming language that I created for learning purposes. 
The file with the code must have an extension .tt .
I created the syntax based on a mixture of languages such as Python and C++.
At the moment there is no language standard, Features in the language will be added gradually depending on my interest in it.
