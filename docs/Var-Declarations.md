# Var Declarations
The declaration of variables occurs in this way
```
type variable;
```
Also, during the declaration of a variable, it can be initialized immediately
```
type variable = value;
```
to declare multiple variables, they can be separated by commas
```
type variable1,variable2;
```
There is also the var keyword, which automatically determines the type of the variable at the compilation stage
```
var variable1 = 10;
var variable2 = 3.1415926
var variable3 = "Hello world!";
var vairable4 = true;
```

## Examples
```
int a = 10;
double b = 3.1415926;
bool c = false;
string d = "Hello world!";
var e = true;
```
