# Arrays
The array declaration occurs in this way.
```
type[size] array;
```
type - type of array element
size - number of elements in the array

Array indexing starts from zero. Indexing by array occurs in this way.
```
array[index];
```
The language also has the ability to create multidimensional arrays.

### Example
```
int[3] array;
array[0] = 0;
array[1] = 1;
array[2] = 2;
```
