- **/** \- Dividing two values
- **+** \- Adding two values
- **-** \- Subtracting two values

- **<** \- Сomparison indicates that the left value is smaller than the right one
- **<=** \- The comparison shows that the left value is less than or equal to the right
- **>** \- Сomparison indicates that the left value is greater than the right one
- **>=** \- The comparison shows that the left value is greater than or equal to the right
- **&** \- Bitwise and
- **|** \- Bitwise or
- **and** \- Logical and
- **or** \- Logical or
- **\=** \- Assigning a value to an element
**The operators are placed in descending order of priority**

There are also combined operators with assignment

- **/=**
- **+=**
- **-=**
- **\*\*=**
